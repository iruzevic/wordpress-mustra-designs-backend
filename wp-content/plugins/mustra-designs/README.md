## Getting started
Follow the instructions:

## Development Pre Start
The script will install npm, composer dependencies and setup coding standards.

```
sh _setup.sh
```

## Development Start
Builds assets in watch mode using Webpack.

```
npm start
```

## Browser sync
We are using BrowserSync to sync assets and enable easy cross-device testing.
To set it up go to `webpack.config.js` and set `proxyUrl` variable to link of your local development.
It is tested on MAMP and Vagrant (VVV).

## Linting Assets (JS,SASS)
We are using Infinum [ES](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@infinumjs/eslint-config) and [Style](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@infinumjs/stylelint-config) linters. 
Lints JS and SASS using Webpack.

```
npm run precommit
```

## Linting PHP ##
We are using [Infinum coding standards for WordPress](https://github.com/infinum/coding-standards-wp) to check php files. There are some subtle differences between ours and WordPress coding standards like spaces vs tabs, 2 spaces vs 4 etc.

To install it, you need to install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) first.

* Add this aliases to you bash config:

```
alias phpcs='vendor/bin/phpcs';
alias phpcbf='vendor/bin/phpcbf';
alias wpcs='phpcs --standard=vendor/infinum/coding-standards-wp/Infinum';
alias wpcbf='phpcbf --standard=vendor/infinum/coding-standards-wp/Infinum';
```
* Reload terminal

Checking plugin for possible violations:
```
wpcs mustra_designs
```

Autofix plugin for minor violations:
```
wpcbf mustra_designs
```

## Build
Build creates public folder in plugin for all the assets.

Check for errors js, css, php but not WP standards

```
sh _prebuild.sh
```

Builds production ready assets

```
sh _build.sh
```

## Note
This means that for the plugin to work you need to have, at the minimum, php 5.3. Although we recommend that you use php 7 because of the performance benefits.
